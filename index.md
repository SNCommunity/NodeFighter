## Welcome to the offical Node Fighter website

### Premise

The exact details of Node Fighter are to be decided (and you can help decide things if you join the offical Node Fighter [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZjpZRmDfBn)), but some cool things are planned. For one, the appeal of Node Fighter will be performance and customizability. For example, all players will have access to a developer console much like the one available in source engine games and, possibly, all players will have the ability to import custom stickfigures exported from Stick Nodes for instant use as figthers in Node Fighter. The game will be performant and lite because it's not being built on a bloaty game engine, but rather a lightweight game development framework called "LibGDX" (which happens to be the same framework Stick Nodes is written in).

Also, the game will be 100% free and open source, forever and always (this includes in-app purchases).
